But close to hiting the 5th month my motivation dropped and I've been coding but not with the same passion and consistency. But I have grit and I am not giving up. I continue and I write everyday to see how I could possible improve my skill set and my desire to continue to grow and learn. Recently I had an aha! moment. I decided why not start The Odin Project? and I went all in about three days ago. At the moment I completed the entire HTML chapter and It made me realise that I am pretty good with HTML. I wasn't allowed to continue the course until I completed the Git and GitHub portion. Today on May 15,th 2022. I managed to complete one chapter which was Github and today I began the Git portion and this is where I stand at today.";
